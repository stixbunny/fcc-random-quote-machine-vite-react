# Random Quote Machine

Final proyect for freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries, a random quote machine generator.

The goal was to make a small app that consumes a quotes API. Users can click to fetch a new random quote. There are both Twitter and Tumblr buttons to shere the content as plain text as well.

This project was developed with React on Vite using [quotable.io](https://api.quotable.io/quotes/random).
